LEoPart integrates particle functionality into the open-source finite element library [FEniCS](www.fenicsproject.org). LEoPart is so much as to say **L**agrangian-**E**ulerian **o**n **Part**icles,
and might remind you of the animal with particles imprinted on its skin.

This library is a branch adding Lagrangian particle tracking, 'do_stepLPT', in the 'advect_particles' class. This adds the ability to move particles based on particle size and density. The LPT has been tailoured to microfluidic channels with assumption of the wall lift.

Main purpose of this library is to advect and project scattered particle data onto a mesh in an accurate and -optionally- (locally) conservative manner. By blending a finite element mesh and
Lagrangian particles, the library enables to solve hyperbolic conservation laws in an accurate and conservative manner, yet free of numerical diffusion. Alternatively, LEoPart might come in handy
if you just need to trace large numbers of particles on a fixed or moving mesh polygonal or polyhedral mesh.

As a bonus, this library shows how **static condensation** principles can be implemented in a rather efficient way in FEniCS.

For a detailed mathematical/implementation background of LEoPart reference is made to a series of papers. We would be grateful if you

## Dependencies
Requires FEniCS 2018.1.0 or FEniCS 2019.1.0
www.fenicsproject.org

Python 3

---

## Package contents
The package source can be found in the directory `./source.` The directory `./unit_tests` contains unit tests for checking essential parts of the code.
Various numerical examples, covering linear scalar advection and incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations are included in the ./tests directory.

## Documentation
Check out the (beta) documentation at https://leopart.readthedocs.io/en/latest

## Old version
**This repo serves as a better, cleaner and faster replacement of the purely Python based library,
which is now hosted at** https://bitbucket.org/jakob_maljaars/leopart_python


## Installation and executing the code
1. Clone the repo via

    ```
    git clone git clone https://jakob_maljaars@bitbucket.org/jakob_maljaars/dolfinparticles.git
    ```
    Using Docker? See Step 2, otherwise go to Step 3
2. If you want to use FEniCS in Docker, run

    ```
    [sudo] docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:[2018.1.0.r1]
    ```

    from the directory where the clone is located.

3. Compile the python wrapper:

    ```
    cd ./source/cpp
    cmake .
    make
    cd ../..
    ```
    Note the cmake command may require configuration if multiple Python installations exist. Otherwise Python may not find the complied cpp library and produce the error   
    ```File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/leopart/ParticleFun.py", line 29, in <module>
          from leopart.cpp import particle_wrapper as compiled_module
    ImportError: cannot import name 'particle_wrapper' from 'leopart.cpp' (unknown location)```
  
  For example `cmake . -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/python3.8`.

4. Add library to your PYTHONPATH

    ```
    python3 setup.py install --prefix=[YOUR PYTHONPATH]
    ```

The code runs in parallel and test found in unit_tests/tests directory can be executed as

```
mpirun -np [N] python3 [YOUR_TEST].py
```
